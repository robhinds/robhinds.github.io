intro: |
  I am an software engineer with 1 year of experience working in software development. I have primarily worked on the ASP.NET MVC, but have worked across a broad range of technologies thereon: C#, Java, Android. 
  As well as spending a reasonable amount of time building applications for the web, which has given me an exposure to a range of javascript technologies over the years, through jQuery.<br/><br/>
