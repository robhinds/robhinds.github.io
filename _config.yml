   Over 7+ years of testing experience in ERP, Web, Service and Mobile Applications with deep understanding of Manual(Lead QA) and Automation testing Experience.
   I'm a Test Automation and Quality Assurance Engineer at Photon Infotech. I specialize in creating software test automation solutions for a variety of web and native applications (IOS, Android, Windows), using open source tools and frameworks (e.g. selenium, appium, mocha, phantomJS). I have solid experience in a few mainstream programming languages... Java, Javascript, Python (not so mainstream, but cool IMHO) but I am a fast learner who thinks about the big picture. I'm also well versed in the CI/CD process ( github/bitbucket, jenkins) with respect to Enterprise and Cloud (Azure/AWS) hosted infrastructures. I'm currently learning how to build and test ReactJS/Native apps on the node platform. I am an avid promoter of innovation and best practices in the software engineering and testing field. I am a tech guy from Bangalore, India, interested in all technology, not just code. I like to spend my time thinking about and working on interesting ideas, meeting interesting people and contributing to projects I care about.
