intro: |
  I am a 26 years old mathematics & computer science student in his last academic year. Passionate about deep learning, algorithms and A.I. in general, I am currently *looking for an internship in these fields of study starting from April 2020*. I am also graduated from HEC Paris 
  and enjoy working on challenging business cases.
